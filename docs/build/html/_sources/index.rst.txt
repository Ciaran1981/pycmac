Welcome to pycmacs's documentation!
============================================

pycmac is a Python module for using the Micmac Structure from Motion (SfM) library within a python environment.

The module also contains various fuctionality for manipulating data associated with the SfM process as well as some enhancements to the basic micmac routines, such as processing Micasense multi-spectral data.  

The aim is to produce convenient, minimal commands for putting together SfM workflows using python and the excellent MicMac lib.
