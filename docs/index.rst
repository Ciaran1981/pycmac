Welcome to pycmacs's documentation!
============================================

A python lib for Micmac and associated geospatial functionality with enhancements and adaptations. 

The lib also facilitates the processing of Micasense multi-spectral imagery to surface reflectance ready for use with MicMac (or indeed others)

All the functionallity of the material in the scripts site (https://github.com/Ciaran1981/Sfm/) is covered here in a more compact form via python.

Documentation is found here, including a quick start. 

https://ciaran1981.github.io/pycmac/build/html/index.html

The aim is to produce convenient, minimal commands for putting together SfM workflows using python and the excellent MicMac lib.
